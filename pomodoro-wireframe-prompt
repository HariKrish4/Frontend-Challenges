Version 1
Create a mobile app wireframe for a minimalist Pomodoro productivity app designed for Indian users. The timer is fixed: 25-minute focus and 5-minute break. Breaks DO NOT auto-start; the user manually starts the break. No long breaks. Include UI text in English. The interface should feel calm, clean, modern, spacing similar to Apple’s design language.

Create wireframes for these screens:

1. Home / Focus timer (before starting):
- Large central timer reading “25:00”
- Subtitle: “Focus Time”
- A single CTA button: “Start Focus Session”
- Small horizontal labels row at the bottom: UPSC, JEE, NEET, Work, Coding
- Language selector (EN | HI | TA)

2. Active Focus Session:
- Countdown at the center
- Subtitle: “Focusing…”
- Buttons: Pause, Stop
- Current label displayed near top

3. Focus Complete Screen:
- Celebration message: “Focus Complete!”
- Summary text: “You completed 25 minutes.”
- CTA: “Start 5-minute Break”
- Session label displayed

4. Break Session (active):
- Timer reading “05:00”
- Subtitle: “Break Time”
- Buttons: Pause, Skip

5. Break Complete Screen:
- Title: “Break Over!”
- CTA: “Start Next Focus Session”

6. Stats screen:
- Today stats: number of Pomodoros completed, total focus minutes
- Weekly bar chart
- Top labels section (UPSC, Work, Coding)

7. Settings screen:
- Language selector (EN, HI, TA)
- Notification toggles (Focus end, Break end)
- Exam presets selection (labels only)
- Timezone: Asia/Kolkata

Use simple greyscale wireframe styling: clear boxes, lines, placeholders, minimal icons. No color styling required. Make everything legible and structured. The output should look like high-fidelity grayscale wireframes for a real mobile app.

Version 2

Generate high-fidelity mobile UI wireframes for a Pomodoro timer app designed for Indian students and professionals. Style should follow minimalist Material Design with clean lines, balanced spacing, consistent grid layout, and clear hierarchy. Use greyscale wireframe components only.

App rules to follow:
- Pomodoro cycle is FIXED: 25-minute focus and 5-minute break.
- Break DOES NOT auto-start; user manually taps “Start Break”.
- No long-break cycle.
- Exam presets are labels only (UPSC, JEE, NEET, Work, Coding).
- App will support English, Hindi, and Tamil (show EN/HI/TA selector).
- Mobile-only design.

Create the following wireframes:

1. Focus Timer (idle):
- Timer text “25:00” centered
- Below text: “Focus Time”
- Large button: “Start Focus”
- Small cycle progress indicator (0/4 cycles)
- Label chips at the bottom

2. Active Focus:
- Large countdown (e.g., 17:42)
- Header showing selected label (e.g., UPSC)
- Buttons: Pause | Stop
- Motivational tip area

3. Focus Complete:
- Title: “Focus Complete!”
- Subtext: “25 minutes done”
- Prominent CTA: “Start Break (5:00)”
- Label display
- Minimal celebratory icon placeholder

4. Break Timer (active):
- Countdown: “05:00”
- Subtitle: “Break Time”
- Buttons: Pause | Skip

5. Break Complete:
- Title: “Break Over!”
- CTA: “Start Next Focus”

6. Stats:
- Daily summary box (Pomodoros completed, total minutes)
- Weekly bar chart (simple rectangles)
- Top categories (label chips)

7. Settings:
- Language switcher (EN, HI, TA)
- Notification toggles (two switches)
- Exam preset labels list
- Timezone display

Use consistent spacing, clear alignment, typographic hierarchy, and standard wireframe symbols. Avoid colors or real images. Make the wireframes look like realistic app blueprints ready for implementation.

Act as a principal engineer. We are building a MOBILE-ONLY Pomodoro app for India using React Native (Expo) + Supabase. You will follow a staged generator protocol. Do NOT write any code until I say “PROCEED WITH CODE”.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
- Fixed Pomodoro cycle: Focus 25:00, Break 5:00. No long break. No configurable durations.
- Break does NOT auto-start; user must tap to start break.
- Exam presets are labels/tags only (UPSC, JEE, NEET, Work, Coding). Labels never alter durations.
- Languages: English, Hindi, Tamil (in-app toggle). IST-first defaults.
- Offline-first using SQLite for local persistence + later sync.
- Local notifications at end of focus and break; must work in background/terminated state; request permissions gracefully.
- Auth: Supabase (email magic link + optional phone OTP). No social logins.
- No community features. Minimal, distraction-free UI.

TECH CHOICES
- React Native (Expo, TypeScript), React Navigation, Zustand store (or Redux Toolkit with justification), expo-notifications (or Notifee with justification), expo-sqlite, Supabase JS SDK.
- i18n: react-i18next; resource JSONs for en/hi/ta; Indic-friendly fonts.
- Optional: Sentry + PostHog plumbing only.

DATA CONTRACT (SPEC ONLY)
- profiles(id uuid=auth.uid, language en|hi|ta default en, timezone 'Asia/Kolkata', created_at)
- sessions(id bigint identity, user_id uuid, type 'focus'|'break', planned_minutes 25|5, actual_minutes 0..60, label text, started_at timestamptz, ended_at timestamptz, device_id text, created_at)
- exam_presets(id serial, title text, description text, locale en|hi|ta, is_active bool)
- RLS: sessions enable RLS; policy owner-only read/write.

ARCHITECTURE EXPECTATIONS
- Timer uses a timestamp-diff approach (monotonic reference) to avoid JS interval drift; scheduled local notifications act as ground-truth boundaries.
- Sync engine: local-first inserts; push to Supabase when online; de-duplicate via deterministic keys (e.g., device_id + started_at ISO). Last-write-wins on conflict.
- App screens: HomeTimer (idle), FocusActive, FocusComplete (manual Start Break CTA), BreakActive, BreakComplete, Stats, Settings, LabelsPicker, Auth.
- Stats: Pomodoros/day, total focus minutes (25 × completed focuses), streak (≥1 focus/day), weekly histogram, top labels.

STAGED GENERATION PROTOCOL (DO NOT CODE YET)
Stage 0 — OUTPUT: Project Blueprint
- 0.1: Print a final folder/file structure with purposes (no code).
- 0.2: Print Supabase SQL DDL for tables + RLS (marked “TO APPLY LATER”).
- 0.3: Print TypeScript interface/type specs for domain models (no implementation).
- 0.4: Print SQLite schema (mirrors Supabase) + migration notes.
- 0.5: Print navigation map (routes/screens & params).
- 0.6: Print notification strategy per platform (permissions, channels, scheduling, handling taps).

Stage 1 — UI Scaffolding (WHEN I SAY “PROCEED WITH CODE”)
- Generate Expo app baseline, navigation, theme, typography, shared components (Button, Chip, Countdown, Card), and i18n setup (en/hi/ta JSON placeholders).

Stage 2 — Domain State & Timer Engine
- Zustand stores (session state machine), timer utilities (timestamp-diff), focus/break flows, pause/stop/skip logic, and background-resilient handling.

Stage 3 — Persistence & Sync
- SQLite repositories, sync queue, reconciliation, device_id strategy, Supabase client init, online/offline detection, RLS-safe inserts/updates.

Stage 4 — Notifications
- Implement scheduling for end-of-focus (25m) and end-of-break (5m), background tap handling, notification channels (Android), permission UX.

Stage 5 — Screens & Flows
- Implement HomeTimer, FocusActive, FocusComplete (manual Start Break), BreakActive, BreakComplete, Stats (queries), Settings (language, notif toggles), LabelsPicker, Auth.

Stage 6 — QA & Telemetry
- Add Sentry + PostHog wiring (optional), lightweight analytics events, a basic Detox test that verifies: start focus → background app → receive notification → resume and complete.

DELIVERABLE FORMAT
- At Stage 0, only produce structured markdown sections per bullet with filenames, brief descriptions, and code-generation notes. No code in Stage 0.
- Wait for my explicit phrase “PROCEED WITH CODE” to continue to Stage 1.
- At each stage, output a file-by-file generation plan first, then the code when I confirm.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (MVP)
- Accurate end-of-session notifications while app is backgrounded/terminated.
- Manual break start only (no auto).
- Fixed durations enforced at the state layer and UI (no settings for duration).
- Offline session capture + later sync to Supabase with RLS policies.
- Multilingual UI switch (EN/HI/TA) with correct Indic rendering.
